# landing-page

In this project, I put my css and html abilities to the test, using services such as flex to create a full stylized landing page.

Throughout this project I learned many unique ways of fitting elements on screen where I owuld like them to be, and realized that there are multiple solutions to every problem.

None of the links or buttons have funtions, this was simply a project to test my abilities with CSS, and not for actual use.
